  "CatSDK": "CatSDK is a simulator SDK that models and emulates hardware or software systems of any type through declarative schemas and behavioral rules. It enables rapid prototyping, testing, and iteration by simulating constraints, I/O, timing, and failure modes without physical devices. Designed for Gemini 3.0 Pro, CatSDK prioritizes deterministic replay, modular adapters, and scalable abstraction across platforms."
